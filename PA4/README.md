# PA4 - Recursive Pathfinding Problem (BBM103 - Fall 2024)

This folder contains my solution for **Project Assignment 4 (PA4)** of the BBM103 - Introduction to Programming course.

## 📌 Topic
This assignment focuses on **recursive problem-solving** using Python.  
We implemented a recursive algorithm to find a path through a 2D matrix with constraints, calculating the cost and updating the path.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `sample_io/`: Contains input matrices and expected output results
- No code file included here, this is the structured input-output set

## 🧪 sample_io/
- `i1.txt` to `i6.txt`: Test input files (matrices and start/end info)
- `o1.txt` to `o4.txt`: Expected output files with result paths and costs

## 🔁 Recursion Details
The recursive function used for traversing the matrix follows these ideas:
- Moves through allowed directions (e.g., right/down/diagonally)
- Tracks visited nodes
- Computes cost
- Marks the correct path with `X` in output

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Recursive thinking
- Matrix traversal
- Input-output handling
- Clean formatting for result presentation
