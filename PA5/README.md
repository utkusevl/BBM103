# PA5 - Algorithmic Sorting and Analysis (BBM103 - Fall 2024)

This folder contains my solution for **Project Assignment 5 (PA5)** of the BBM103 - Introduction to Programming course.

## üìå Topic
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing the performance of three classic sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

The program reads warehouse data from a CSV file and sorts the entries by:
1. Priority Level (ascending)
2. Package Count (ascending)

## üìÅ Folder Structure
- `PA5.pdf`: Project description and requirements
- `hw05.py`: Python source file implementing all sorting methods
- `hw05_input.csv`: Dataset to be sorted
- `hw05_output.txt`: Output containing sorted results and performance metrics

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on implementation of sorting algorithms
- Dual-level custom sorting logic
- Algorithmic performance comparison
- Writing to structured output file
- Python I/O and CSV parsing

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed. To run the project:

```bash
python3 hw05.py
```

Results will be written to `hw05_output.txt` automatically.
